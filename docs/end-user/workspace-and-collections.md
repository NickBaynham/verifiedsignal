# Workspace and collections

## Concepts

- **Organization** — A tenant boundary (your team or personal workspace). You belong to one or more via **membership**.
- **Collection** — A folder-like group of **documents** inside an organization. Permissions today follow **“can access collection if you are a member of its organization.”**
- **Inbox** — When your account is first provisioned, you typically receive a default collection named **Inbox** in your **personal workspace** (unless your deployment uses a different onboarding flow).

## Automatic setup from your login

When **`VERIFIEDSIGNAL_AUTO_PROVISION_IDENTITY`** is enabled (default in many deployments):

1. You complete [sign-in](signing-in.md) and obtain an **access token**.
2. The **first protected API call** with `Authorization: Bearer …` can create, if missing:
   - your **user** record (linked to your Supabase id),
   - a **personal organization**,
   - **owner** membership,
   - an **Inbox** collection.

This is safe to repeat; it does not duplicate your workspace.

## Optional: sync identity explicitly

**`POST /auth/sync-identity`**  
**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`

**Response (JSON)** includes:

- **`database_user_id`** — internal user id in Postgres
- **`organization_ids`** — orgs you belong to
- **`collection_ids`** — collections visible through those orgs

Use this if your app wants a dedicated “prepare workspace” step right after login.

## List your collections

**`GET /api/v1/collections`**  
**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`

**Response:** `collections` array. Each item includes **`id`**, **`name`**, **`slug`**, **`organization_id`**, **`document_count`**, and timestamps.

Use a collection’s **`id`** as **`collection_id`** when uploading files or submitting URLs (see [Documents](documents.md)).

## Collection analytics

**`GET /api/v1/collections/{collection_id}/analytics`** (Bearer required, same access rules as the collection) returns **index facets** (ingest source, status, content type, tags) and **Postgres rollups** over canonical document scores. See [Search and live updates — Collection analytics](search-and-events.md#collection-analytics).

## Your profile

**`GET /api/v1/users/me`**  
**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`

**Response (JSON)** includes:

- **`user_id`** — the JWT subject (Supabase user id)
- **`database_user_id`** — linked Postgres user when provisioned
- **`email`**, **`display_name`** — when present in the token claims

## Choosing a collection for new documents

- Prefer the **Inbox** (or another collection) from **`GET /api/v1/collections`**.
- Some deployments allow **omitting** `collection_id` on upload; the server then uses a configured default (often a shared dev inbox). **Production** setups may require an explicit **`collection_id`** so content never lands in the wrong place—ask your administrator.
